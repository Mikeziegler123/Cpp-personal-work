codel * Write a simple main program which utilizes your Date 
 * class and place the program in date_main.cpp .  The 
 * program should create a birth date and a graduation 
 * date containing your birthday and a tentative date for your 
 * graduation from MTSU.  Print the dates in the form MM/DD/YY 
 * using your display Date method as described in exercises 6 and 7 above.
 * Turn in a printout containing a listing of the three files date.h, 
 * date.cpp, and date_main.cpp, a compile and a run.
